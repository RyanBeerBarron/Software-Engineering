This is my assignment for the lowest common ancestor with a binary tree.

I have decided to do this exercise using LISP, more precisely Common LISP, which I have never used before, so it will require me to learn how to program with LISP and all its related technologies.
I am using the SBCL implementation of Common LISP.

I am using lisp-unit for unit testing of my software as it is easy to use. Source: https://github.com/OdonataResearchLLC/lisp-unit
And I am using a basic binary tree program which I've found on gitHub, bst.lisp Source: https://github.com/glv2/bst

To compile and run the code, start sbcl in the repo and type in '(load "load.lisp")'. This will load all the files in the right order.
To run the tests, type in the REPL '(lisp-unit:run-tests :all :lca-test)'.
And '(quit)' to safely quit the REPL.
